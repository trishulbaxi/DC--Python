Advanced Programmatic Methods:

In this section, I explore two advanced methods for enhancing the Python code developed in earlier stages of this project.

Due to intellectual property concerns, the source code has been removed from this document.

As indicated in the README file, if you are a recruiter or hiring manager interested in this project, I am available to provide a walkthrough and demonstration. Please reach out to me via LinkedIn.

As of the latest update, there have been at least 5 clones of this repository. I hope that those who have cloned the repository have found the code beneficial for their learning journey. Feedback from users is always welcome and appreciated.
